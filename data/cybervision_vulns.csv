    –Plant security: Physical prevention of access to critical components
    –Network security: Ensure that PLC systems are not connected to untrusted networks
    –System integrity: Configure, maintain and protect your device by applying applicable compensating controls and using built-in security capabilities.

This contrasts with normal C strings which are repesented as a buffer for the string data which is terminated with a NUL (0) byte. Although not a strict requirement, ASN.1 strings that are parsed using OpenSSL's own ""d2i"" functions (and other similar parsing functions) as well as any string whose value has been set with the ASN1_STRING_set() function will additionally NUL terminate the byte array in the ASN1_STRING structure. However, it is possible for applications to directly construct valid ASN1_STRING structures which do not NUL terminate the byte array by directly setting the ""data"" and ""length"" fields in the ASN1_STRING array. This can also happen by using the ASN1_STRING_set0() function. Numerous OpenSSL functions that print ASN.1 data have been found to assume that the ASN1_STRING byte array will be NUL terminated, even though this is not guaranteed for strings that have been directly constructed. Where an application requests an ASN.1 structure to be printed, and where that ASN.1 structure contains ASN1_STRINGs that have been directly constructed by the application without NUL terminating the ""data"" field, then a read buffer overrun can occur. The same thing can also occur during name constraints processing of certificates (for example if a certificate has been directly constructed by the application instead of loading it via the OpenSSL parsing functions, and the certificate contains non NUL terminated ASN1_STRING structures). It can also occur in the X509_get1_email(), X509_REQ_get1_email() and X509_get1_ocsp() functions. If a malicious actor can cause an application to directly construct an ASN1_STRING and then process it through one of the affected OpenSSL functions then this issue could be hit. This might result in a crash (causing a Denial of Service attack). It could also result in the disclosure of private memory contents (such as private keys, or sensitive plaintext).

Siemens has identified the following specific workarounds and mitigations and strongly recommends that customers apply them to reduce the risk:
•  Apply password protection for S7 communication
• Disallow client connections via the ENDIS_PW instruction of the S7-1200 or S7-1500 CPU (This blocks remote client connections, even when the client can provide the correct password)
• Use the display to configure additional access protection of the S7-1500 CPU (This blocks remote client connections, even when the client can provide the correct password)
• Apply “defense in depth” as outlined on pages 12ff of the operational guidelines for Industrial Security, especially:
    –Plant security: Physical prevention of access to critical components
    –Network security: Ensure that PLC systems are not connected to untrusted networks
    –System integrity: Configure, maintain and protect your device by applying applicable compensating controls and using built-in security capabilities.
• Update your entire solution to TIA Portal V17 and use TLS communication using individual certificates between PLC, HMIs and PG/PC",79b97c90-718a-4eb6-bf27-e7b0f5fbff0d_CVE-2020-15782_28/03/2025,CyberVision,28/03/2025,Critical,61,None

•  Apply password protection for S7 communication
• Disallow client connections via the ENDIS_PW instruction of the S7-1200 or S7-1500 CPU (This blocks remote client connections, even when the client can provide the correct password)
• Use the display to configure additional access protection of the S7-1500 CPU (This blocks remote client connections, even when the client can provide the correct password)
• Apply “defense in depth” as outlined on pages 12ff of the operational guidelines for Industrial Security, especially:
    –Plant security: Physical prevention of access to critical components
    –Network security: Ensure that PLC systems are not connected to untrusted networks
    –System integrity: Configure, maintain and protect your device by applying applicable compensating controls and using built-in security capabilities.

192.168.1.6,Cisco Cyber Vision,CyberVision,CyberVision-CVE-2021-3712,28/03/2025,open,CVE-2021-3712,OpenSSL - Read buffer overruns processing ASN.1 strings Vulnerability,7.4,High,None,None,9d62b84b-cc6f-49b9-bd41-b4c50a17f23a,plcxb1d0ed,192.168.1.6,"['e0:dc:a0:49:49:76', '10:f9:20:8b:0b:1a', '34:ed:1b:52:95:00', 'f8:b7:e2:b4:ba:23']",None,"IO Module,Controller",None,None,"ASN.1 strings are represented internally within OpenSSL as an ASN1_STRING structure which contains a buffer holding the string data and a field holding the buffer length. This contrasts with normal C strings which are repesented as a buffer for the string data which is terminated with a NUL (0) byte. Although not a strict requirement, ASN.1 strings that are parsed using OpenSSL's own ""d2i"" functions (and other similar parsing functions) as well as any string whose value has been set with the ASN1_STRING_set() function will additionally NUL terminate the byte array in the ASN1_STRING structure. However, it is possible for applications to directly construct valid ASN1_STRING structures which do not NUL terminate the byte array by directly setting the ""data"" and ""length"" fields in the ASN1_STRING array. This can also happen by using the ASN1_STRING_set0() function. Numerous OpenSSL functions that print ASN.1 data have been found to assume that the ASN1_STRING byte array will be NUL terminated, even though this is not guaranteed for strings that have been directly constructed. Where an application requests an ASN.1 structure to be printed, and where that ASN.1 structure contains ASN1_STRINGs that have been directly constructed by the application without NUL terminating the ""data"" field, then a read buffer overrun can occur. The same thing can also occur during name constraints processing of certificates (for example if a certificate has been directly constructed by the application instead of loading it via the OpenSSL parsing functions, and the certificate contains non NUL terminated ASN1_STRING structures). It can also occur in the X509_get1_email(), X509_REQ_get1_email() and X509_get1_ocsp() functions. If a malicious actor can cause an application to directly construct an ASN1_STRING and then process it through one of the affected OpenSSL functions then this issue could be hit. This might result in a crash (causing a Denial of Service attack). It could also result in the disclosure of private memory contents (such as private keys, or sensitive plaintext).

    Block all traffic to Ethernet/IP or other CIP protocol-based devices from outside the Manufacturing Zone by blocking or restricting access to Port 2222/TCP and UDP and Port 44818/TCP and UDP using proper network infrastructure controls, such as firewalls, UTM devices, or other security appliances.

    Minimize network exposure for all control system devices and/or systems, and ensure they are not accessible from the Internet.
    When remote access is required, use secure methods, such as Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), recognizing that VPNs may have vulnerabilities and should be updated to the most current version available.

This vulnerability is due to an improper check in the code function that manages the verification of the digital signatures of system image files during the initial boot process. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by loading unsigned software on an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to boot a malicious software image or execute unsigned code and bypass the image verification check part of the boot process of the affected device.
To exploit this vulnerability, the attacker needs either unauthenticated physical access to the device or privileged access to the root shell on the device.
Note: In Cisco IOS XE Software releases 16.11.1 and later, root shell access is protected by the Consent Token mechanism. However, an attacker with level-15 privileges could easily downgrade the Cisco IOS XE Software running on a device to a release where root shell access is more readily available.
